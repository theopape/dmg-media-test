Please note:

I used the block scaffolding, so just left some defaults in there.

I didn't have time to optimise further; but that you could store the attributes in post meta to speed up the CLI queries.

Also not sure if you want the paragraph as the block, but that there should be plenty there for you to make an assessment, anyhow!
